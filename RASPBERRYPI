# Instruction to Attach kiwisdr to RaspberryPi Board
[Updated Apr 27, 2020]

This instruction describes how to build an adapter to attach a kiwisdr board to a RaspberryPi 3B.

## Pinout connections
  There are 16 pins to connect to RPI board. All 16 pins are in the left connector of the board when you are placing kiwisdr board ANT up and the pins face to you. The following diagram shows the connections.

  Kiwi Board (ANT up, Pin face you)
    LEFT CONN
  -----------
  |GND   GND|
  |3.3    --|
  |--     --|
  |5V     5V|
  |--     --|
  |--    PGM|
  |--   INIT|
  |--    CS1|
  |CS0  MOSI|
  |SCL   SDA|
  |MISO SCLK|
  |CMD   SND|
  |--     --|

The following tables explains the connections
3.3 ->        pin 1
5V  ->        pin 2, pin 4
GND ->        pin 6, pin 25

SDA -> I2C1 SDA, pin 3
SCL -> I2C1 SCL, pin 5

CS0 -> SPI0 CS0, pin 24
CS1 -> SPI0 CS1, pin 26
MOSI -> SPIO MOSI, pin 19
MISO -> SPIO MISO, pin 21
SCLK -> SPI0 SCLK, pin 23

PGM -> GPIO5, pin 29
INIT -> GPIO6, pin 31
CMD -> GPIO13, pin 33
SND -> GPIO26, pin 37
